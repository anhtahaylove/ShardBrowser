//! Passphrase-derived file key encryption key (FKEK) for local backups.
//!
//! A local backup has no server and no device enrolment to lean on, so the FKEK
//! comes from something the user knows. The point of a backup is that it opens
//! on a *different* machine — a key sealed into this machine's keystore would
//! make the backup worthless in the case it exists for — so nothing here is
//! persisted except a random salt, which is stored in the clear alongside the
//! container and is not secret.
//!
//! Argon2id, because the threat is an offline attacker with the backup file and
//! unlimited guesses. A fast KDF (PBKDF2 at typical iteration counts, or a bare
//! hash) would let commodity GPUs run through a human-chosen passphrase list;
//! Argon2id's memory cost is what makes that expensive per guess.
